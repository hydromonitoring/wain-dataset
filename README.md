## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Make sure you have Git installed on your machine.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hydromonitoring/wain-dataset.git
cd wain-dataset
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you're using **Node.js version 18**. You can check your version with:

```bash
node -v
```

If you're not using Node 18, consider using a version manager like `nvm`:

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

Then install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
